According to the manuscript “The approbatory social welfare function: First results” by Santos-Garcia and JCR Alcantud, the following Mathematica code reports the exact number of preference-approval structures, as a function of $n$ and $a$, i.e., of the cardinalities of both $X$ and the approved alternatives $A$.

The notebook WA-v4.nb contains the Mathematica code for the calculation of the consistent preference-approval model function.

The outputs of the tables for the WA function are shown in the files WA-7.pdf, WA-8.pdf and W9-7.pdf for n values of 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
